"""Real-drone flight-command relay (WebSocket).

Reverse direction of the telemetry pipeline — commands travel
browser -> server -> desktop -> drone:

    SPA useDroneCommands (Real Drone -> Livestream Host, Takeoff/Landing)
      -> WS /api/drone/command             (this module, browser side)
        -> WS /api/drone/command/downlink  (this module, relay side)
          -> extension/crazyflie_bridge/telemetry_relay.py command_forwarder()
            -> motion_control_ws.py (owns the Crazyflie link, ws://:8765)

Kept deliberately separate from telemetry.py: commands are validated against
a strict whitelist (action + numeric clamps mirroring
motion_control_ws._handle_command) before they are forwarded — the server
never relays arbitrary payloads to the drone.

Downlink auth: same shared secret as telemetry publish
(config.json -> "drone" -> "telemetry_token", passed as ?token=...).

Acks: every browser command gets an immediate {"type": "ack", ...} frame so
the UI can tell apart "delivered towards the drone" from "no drone link".
The ack means the command was forwarded to the desktop relay; the bridge
itself may still refuse it (e.g. the USB-cable takeoff interlock).
