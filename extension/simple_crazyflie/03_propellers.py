r"""Verify propeller assembly — spin each motor individually and check
its direction BY EYE.

The Crazyflie 2.1 motor layout (X-configuration, top-down view):

             Front
        M4 (CW)    M1 (CCW)
             \    /
              \  /
              /  \
             /    \
        M3 (CCW)   M2 (CW)
             Back

Each motor must spin in the direction shown AND carry the matching
propeller type (CW or CCW).  A wrong prop or wrong motor order makes
the drone flip on takeoff.

Run:  python 03_propellers.py

Why by eye and not by the gyroscope?  A single small propeller on a
grounded quad produces a yaw reaction torque far below the gyro's
vibration-rectification noise floor.  In practice the gyro reading
during a one-motor spin is dominated by vibration artifacts — the
same motor can read +0.16 rad/s in one run and +1.28 rad/s in the
next, with the sign unrelated to the actual spin direction.  Human
eyes (plus a phone in slow-motion mode if needed) are the reliable
sensor for this check.

The script spins each motor one at a time via motorPowerSet so you
can see exactly which motor spins and in which direction.  If the
motorPowerSet params are missing from this firmware, all four motors
are spun together during the hover instead.

After the individual check the script performs a short hover at
~20 cm.  This catches the one fault a spin-direction check cannot:
a propeller mounted upside-down (correct rotation, but no lift).
